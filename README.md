# 🚔 Crime Intelligence & Forecasting System

An end-to-end data science system that analyzes crime patterns, detects high-risk zones, and forecasts future crime trends using both statistical and machine learning models.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Urban crime analysis requires:

- Identification of high-risk geographic zones  
- Detection of temporal crime trends  
- Reliable forecasting for resource allocation  

This project builds a complete crime intelligence pipeline combining spatial clustering, statistical forecasting, and machine learning regression.

## 📊 Dataset

Chicago Crime Dataset  
~1.45 million records  

Key Features:

- Date  
- Primary Crime Type  
- Latitude & Longitude  
- Location Description  

Two structured datasets were created:

- `crime_intelligence_dataset.csv` → Spatial intelligence  
- `daily_crime_series.csv` → Time-series forecasting

## 📈 Statistical Time-Series Forecasting (Week 3)

### Steps Performed
- Daily aggregation of crime counts
- Moving averages (7-day, 30-day)
- Stationarity testing (ADF Test)
- Differencing for stationarity
- ARIMA modeling
- SARIMA modeling
- Model comparison using RMSE

### Statistical Model Comparison

| Model | RMSE |
|--------|--------|
| ARIMA(1,1,1) | 106.97 |
| SARIMA | 136.19 |

ARIMA was selected as the better statistical baseline model.
